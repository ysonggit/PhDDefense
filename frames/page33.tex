\begin{frame}{1.Construct Authority Tree}{Decide to be root or descendant}
  \textbf{Key Idea:} Each robot forms an authority containing only its
  own ID, compares it with the authorities of remaining messages.
  %The robots use these authorities to establish a collection of authority trees
  \begin{columns}[T] % align columns

      \begin{itemize}
      \item {\textcolor{red}{Root}: Robot who has the highest authority}
      \item {\textcolor{blue}{Descendant}: Robot selects the neighbor who sends
          the highest authority and has matching with it as its parent}
      \item {\textcolor{orange}{Orphan}: Robot who has no matching}
      \end{itemize}
