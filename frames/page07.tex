\begin{frame}{Simulation: Navigation Task}
    \begin{block}{Ultimate Objective} 
       Form a plan $\pi$ for the robot to execute using the information available in
       the I-space.
    \end{block}

    \textbf{In a navigation task, we assume:}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A point robot follows predefined waypoints guided by centroid point of the
      (approximated) I-state
    \item Robot can detect presence but not distance to the landmarks
    \item Landmarks are pseudo-randomly generated
    \item Initial (approximated) I-state is given
    \end{itemize}
