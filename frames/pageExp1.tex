\begin{frame}{Simulation}
We run simulations of $3$ repeating patterns: square, hexagon, octagon-square.
   \begin{enumerate}
   \item For each lattice pattern, we vary the number of robots $n$ between $50$ and $250$ in increments of $50$. 
   \item For each $n$, we run $50$ trials with random initial poses.
   \end{enumerate}
