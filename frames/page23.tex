\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item CGA is effective for representing a robot's uncertain information about
    the current state
  \item The form of double-rectangle is more accurate in approximating the non-convex
    \emph{I-state}
  \item The robot can complete the navigation task using approximated I-state with
    low approximation accuracy
  \end{enumerate}
